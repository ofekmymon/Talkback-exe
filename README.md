Hello and welcome to talkback. 
Talkback is a realtime chatting application where you can chat with all active users you want at the same time! In addition to chatting you can also play connect-4 with them. The connect-4 saves scores for the current session and also has the option to rematch with the player you play with.
All you have to do is download the project, unzip it, and start via the Talkback.exe!
*Might take a minute for the first time because the server is a sleep*
